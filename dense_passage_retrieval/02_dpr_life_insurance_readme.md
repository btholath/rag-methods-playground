# üîç Dense Passage Retrieval for Life Insurance FAQs
A smart AI-powered script that finds the **most relevant answers** to life insurance questions using **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)** and state-of-the-art transformer models.

---


## What This Script Does
- **Question Answering**: Given a natural language insurance question, retrieves the most relevant passage from a set of life insurance facts.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to match meaning‚Äînot just keywords‚Äîbetween questions and answers.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Ranks statements by cosine similarity, ensuring the best answer is always surfaced.

## How It Works (Step by Step)
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Load AI Models**
   - The script loads two AI models, one for understanding questions and another for understanding statements.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **User Question**
   - You provide a question, like "What are the benefits of whole life insurance?"
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Turn the Question into Numbers**
   - The question is converted into a unique numerical pattern (embedding) so the AI can compare it with other information.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Compare Against Life Insurance Facts**
   - A list of life insurance-related statements (like "Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage.") is also converted into numbers.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Find the Closest Match**
   - The script measures similarity between your question and each statement using a special technique called cosine similarity.
- 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Display the Best Answer**
   - It picks the most relevant statement and shows it to you, like "Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage with a guaranteed death benefit."
     It‚Äôs like an AI-powered FAQ system that can match questions with the most relevant answers automatically!

## Technical Details
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) using pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face. Here‚Äôs the technical breakdown:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Initialization
  - Loads DPRQuestionEncoder (facebook/dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base) for encoding queries.
  - Loads DPRContextEncoder (facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base) for encoding documents.
  - Tokenizers (DPRQuestionEncoderTokenizer & DPRContextEncoderTokenizer) are used for text preprocessing.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Query Encoding
  - The input question is tokenized and passed through DPRQuestionEncoder, generating a query embedding (pooler_output).
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Document Encoding
  - A predefined list of life insurance passages is tokenized and processed via DPRContextEncoder, generating context embeddings.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cosine Similarity Calculation
  - Uses sklearn‚Äôs cosine_similarity to compute similarity between the query embedding and all context embeddings.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieval Ranking
  - The passage with the highest cosine similarity score is selected as the most relevant answer to the query.
- 6Ô∏è‚É£ Result Output
  - The script prints the best-matching passage as the AI's response.

## Use Cases for DPR
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) excels at quickly finding the most relevant information from large collections of unstructured text. Some practical applications include:

- Open-Domain Question Answering
  - Retrieve precise passages from extensive datasets or knowledge bases to answer user queries in natural language, even when the answer isn‚Äôt in a fixed set of documents.

- Document Retrieval
  - Efficiently locate and rank documents or passages related to a specific query‚Äîideal for legal research, academic literature, and enterprise knowledge management.

- Customer Support Automation
  - Instantly match customer questions with the most relevant support articles, FAQs, or troubleshooting guides, enabling faster and more accurate responses.

- Enterprise Search
  - Power internal tools to help employees find policies, SOPs, manuals, or other resources spread across large document repositories.

- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
  - Enable conversational agents to provide contextually accurate answers by retrieving and presenting the best-matching information from company data.
