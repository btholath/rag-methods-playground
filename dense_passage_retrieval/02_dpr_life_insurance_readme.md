## Script: /dense_passage_retrieval/02_dpr_life_insurance.py

## What This Does
‚úÖ Uses DPR for insurance-related queries
‚úÖ Retrieves the most relevant passage from insurance-related data
‚úÖ Provides similarity scoring for ranking information


This Python script is like a smart assistant that helps find the most relevant information about Life Insurance from a given list of statements. Here‚Äôs how it works step by step:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load AI models üß†
- The script loads two AI models, one for understanding questions and another for understanding statements.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ask a Question ‚ùì
- You provide a question, like "What are the benefits of whole life insurance?"
3Ô∏è‚É£ Turn the Question into Numbers üî¢
- The question is converted into a unique numerical pattern (embedding) so the AI can compare it with other information.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Compare Against Life Insurance Facts üìÑ
- A list of life insurance-related statements (like "Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage.") is also converted into numbers.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Closest Match üéØ
- The script measures similarity between your question and each statement using a special technique called cosine similarity.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Display the Best Answer ‚úÖ
- It picks the most relevant statement and shows it to you, like "Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage with a guaranteed death benefit."
It‚Äôs like an AI-powered FAQ system that can match questions with the most relevant answers automatically!


## Technical Details
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) using pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face. Here‚Äôs the technical breakdown:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Initialization
- Loads DPRQuestionEncoder (facebook/dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base) for encoding queries.
- Loads DPRContextEncoder (facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base) for encoding documents.
- Tokenizers (DPRQuestionEncoderTokenizer & DPRContextEncoderTokenizer) are used for text preprocessing.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Query Encoding
- The input question is tokenized and passed through DPRQuestionEncoder, generating a query embedding (pooler_output).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Document Encoding
- A predefined list of life insurance passages is tokenized and processed via DPRContextEncoder, generating context embeddings.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cosine Similarity Calculation
- Uses sklearn‚Äôs cosine_similarity to compute similarity between the query embedding and all context embeddings.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieval Ranking
- The passage with the highest cosine similarity score is selected as the most relevant answer to the query.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Result Output
- The script prints the best-matching passage as the AI's response.
