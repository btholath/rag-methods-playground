ChromaDB is an open-source vector database designed for storing and retrieving embeddings—numerical representations of text, images, or other unstructured data. It is primarily used in AI applications that require semantic search, similarity matching, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Key Use Cases
- Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) – ChromaDB helps LLMs retrieve relevant context from stored embeddings, improving responses.
- Semantic Search – Instead of keyword-based search, it finds conceptually similar documents based on meaning.
- Recommendation Systems – Used in personalized content recommendations by matching user preferences with stored embeddings.
- Chatbots & AI Assistants – Helps AI systems retrieve relevant knowledge dynamically.
- Document Indexing & Retrieval – Stores and retrieves large-scale text embeddings efficiently.



In Codespaces:
Codespaces will automatically detect your Dockerfile and build it if you have a .devcontainer setup (see next section).

You can open a terminal and run:
docker build -t rag-rerank .
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/app rag-rerank
Or just use the Codespace terminal inside the running container:

Inside the running container or Codespace terminal:
python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"

Run Your Script
python reranking.py
